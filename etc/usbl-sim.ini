# From USBL we dispatch UamTxField messages, which are consumed by the AcousticModem.
# The message flags field contain an ACK flag, which indicates a ranging operation.
# The destination vehicle then responds with a UamRxField message, which is consumed by the AcousticModem.
# The AcousticModem identifies the "REPLY" message in the UamRxField, and dispatches a UamRxRange message,
# which is consumed by the USBL, thus obtaining the range.
